UNBUFFERED CHANNEL:- used for synchronizing between goroutines
BUFFERED CHANNEL:- it has a capacity defined at creation and used ,if you want to seperate the timing for sending and receiving operations and also to send multiple values

PROS:
UNBUFFERED - .synchronizing is simple
             .easy to detect deadlocks
BUFFERED - gives asynchronus communication and decoupling 

CONS:
UNBUFFERED - .no asynchronus communication
             .sending and receiving are blocking operations( which leads to deadlocks)

channel depends on the specific needs of our application and the patterns you are implementing.
